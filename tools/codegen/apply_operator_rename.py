"""Rename legacy operator classes/files to Camel(regular_token).

Completes the RENAME/PROMOTE token migration: an operator's class name, files,
CMake add_plugin name, and parser-glue references must all derive from its
genuine MEOS symbol (class == Camel(token) == Camel(symbol.upper())), the same
shape codegen emits. This keeps the binding fully catalog-derivable and lets the
streaming-parity adapter map token<->operator by name.

Resolution: for every operator .cpp under Functions/Meos and Aggregation/.../Meos,
read its genuine meos_call (last streamable call that is not a type converter).
If that symbol is a RENAME/PROMOTE target, the operator's regular class stem is
Camel(regular_token); rename the class everywhere if it differs.

Usage: tools/codegen/apply_operator_rename.py [--apply]   (default dry-run)
