"""Check that the generator states no MEOS fact of its own.

The question this answers
-------------------------
A generator accumulates tables. Some are legitimate and some are drift, and by
eye the two are indistinguishable, which is how a map that sent every
`trgeometry` symbol to the wrong header survived beside four correct entries,
and how five whole families ended up with no header at all.

The line is not a matter of taste, and it can be checked. A generator may hold
the facts of its OWN target — how a C type becomes a NebulaStream Nautilus
type, how a temporal instant is decomposed into stream columns — because
nothing upstream knows them. It may not hold a fact the catalog already
states: which header declares a symbol, what parses a type, which functions
belong to a family. Those are MEOS's, the catalog carries them, and a copy can
only go stale.

So the rule is mechanical: a hand-written table in the generator may not be
KEYED BY, or hold, a MEOS type or symbol name. The catalog supplies the
vocabulary to check against, so this needs no list of its own and no
maintenance as MEOS grows.

What it does not check
----------------------
Names appearing inside a docstring, a comment, or a classifier's matching logic
are not tables — a shape that recognises `ever_eq` is reading a name, not
storing a fact about one. Only module-level literal containers are examined.
